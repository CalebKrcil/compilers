Compilers Final Code Gen HW7 Partner Participation:
Gabe Turner: 2/2

***Important
If the test cases do not work with our compiler, we have provided a run_tests.sh script that
will run some examples in a folder named "finaltests" all that needs to be done is to 
chmod +x the script and run it in the base directory. There are some silly things that 
our compiler does that are features, namely when printing you can only pass println a single
string, int, or double, and they cannot be combined. Functions are also limited to 6 params
because of assembly addresses.
If there are other issues we will give a demo of all of the functionality our compiler has.
